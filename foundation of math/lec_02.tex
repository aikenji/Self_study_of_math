\section{Relations and Functions}
\subsection{Ordered pairs}
In mathematics, relations and functions are usually defined in terms of ordered pairs. The key property the ordered pairs satisfied is as below
\begin{definition}{Ordered pairs}{}
    Basic property the ordered pairs should satisfy, which is also the axiomatic definition of ordered pairs
    \begin{equation*}
        \langle a,b \rangle = \langle c,d \rangle \iff a = b \land c = d
    \end{equation*}
\end{definition}
In 1921, Kazimierz Kuratowski give the construction of ordered pair based on ZF systems. 
\begin{definition}{Set based construction}{}
    The \textbf{ordered pair}, with first component x and second component y, is the set defined by
    \begin{equation*}
        \langle x,y \rangle = \{\{x\}, \{x, y\}\}
    \end{equation*}
\end{definition}
